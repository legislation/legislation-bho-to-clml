		<para id="p2">Whereas great Frauds and Deceits are too often practised by necessitous and evil disposed Persons in
borrowing of money and giving Judgments Statutes and Recognizances privately for securing the repayment
of the said money and the same persons do afterwards borrow money upon security of their Lands of other Persons
and do not acquaint the latter Lender thereof with the same whereby such late Lender is very often in danger to
lose his whole money or forced to pay of the Debts secured by the said Judgments Statutes and Recognizances
before they can have any benefitt of the said Mortgages. And whereas divers Persons do many times mortgage
their Lands more then once without giving notice of their first mortgage whereby Lenders of money vpon second
or after mortgages doe often lose their money and are put to great charges in suits and otherwise. For remedy
whereof and preventing the same as much as may be for the future Be it enacted by the King and Queens most
excellent Majesties by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and the Co[m]mons
in this present Parliament assembled and by the Authority of the same That if any Person or Persons from and
