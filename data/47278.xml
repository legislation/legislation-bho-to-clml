		<para id="p2">In all humble manner shew unto Your most Excellent Majestie Your Majestyes most duty full and loyall Subje&bholigct;s
the Lord&bholngs; and Commons in Parliament assembled That the Horrid and Execrable Murder of Your Majestyes
Royall Father our late most Gratious Soveraigne Charles the First of ever blessed and glorious memory hath
beene committed by a party of wretched men desperately wicked and hardened in their impietie, who haveing
first plotted and contrived the ruine and distru&bholigct;ion of this excellent Monarchy, and with it of the true Reformed
Protestant Religion which had beene soe long prote&bholigct;ed by it and flourished under it, found it necessary in order
to [their <ref idref="n1">1</ref>] carrying on of their pernitious and traiterous designes to throw downe all the Bulwarks and Fences of
Law, and to subvert the very being and constitution of Parliament that soe they might at last make their way
open for any further attempts upon the Sacred person of his Majestie himselfe, And that for the more easy
effe&bholigct;ing thereof they did first seduce some part of the then Army into a compliance and then kepte the rest in
subje&bholigct;ion to them partly for hopes of preferment and cheifely for feare of looseing their imployments and arreares
untill by these and other more odious arts and devices they had fully strengthened themselves both in power and
fa&bholigct;ion, which being done they did declare against all manner of Treaties with the person of the King even then
while a Treaty by advice of both Houses of Parliament was in being remonstrate against the Houses of Parliament
for such proceedings, seize upon His Royall person while the Commissioners were returned to the House of
Parliament with his Answere, and when his concessions had beene voted a ground for peace, seize upon the
House of Commons seclude and imprison some Members force out others and there being left but a small remnant
of their owne Creatures (not a tenth part of the whole) did seeke to shelter themselves by this weake pretence
under the name and authoritie of a Parliament, and in that name laboured to prosecute what was yet behinde
and unfinished of their long intended Treason and Conspiricie, To this purpose they prepared an Ordinance
for ere&bholigct;ing a prodigious and unheard of Tribunall which they called An High Court of Justice for tryall of his
Majestie and haveing easily procured it to passe in their House of Commons as it then stood moulded ventured to
send it up from thence to the Peeres then sitting who totally reje&bholigct;ed it, whereupon their rage and fury increasing
they presume to passe it alone as an A&bholigct; of the Commons and in the name of the Commons of England, and haveing
gained the pretence of Law made by a power of their owne makeing pursue it with all possible force and cruelty
untill at last upon the thirtyeth day of January One thousand six hundred forty and eight His Sacred Majestie was
brought unto a Scaffold and there publiquely murthered before the Gates of his owne Royall Pallace, And because
by this horred a&bholigct;ion the Protestant Religion hath received the greatest wound and reproach and the people of
England the most insupportable shame and infamy that it was possible for the enimies of God and the King to
bring upon us whilst the Fanatick Rage of a few Miscreants (who were as farr from being true Protestants as they
were from being true Subje&bholigct;s) stand&bholngs; imputed by our Adversaries to the whole Nation, We therefore your Majestyes
said dutyfull and loyall Subje&bholigct;s the Lord&bholngs; and Commons in Parliament assembled doe hereby renounce abominate
and protest against that Impious Fa&bholigct;, the execrable Murther and most [unparreled <ref idref="n2">2</ref>] Treason committed against the
Sacred person and life of our said late Soveraigne Your Majestyes most Royall Father, and all proceedings tending
thereunto, And doe beseech Your most Excellent Majestie that it may be declared, And be it hereby declared
That by the undoubted and Fundamentall Lawes of this Kingdome, neither the Peeres of this Realme nor the
Commons nor both together in Parliament or out of Parliament, nor the people colle&bholigct;ively or [presentatively<ref idref="n3">3</ref>] nor

Kings of this Realme, And for the better vindication of our selves to posteritie, and as a lasting Monument of our
otherwise inexpressible detestation and abhorrency of this villanous and abominable Fa&bholigct; We doe further beseech
Your most Excellent Majestie that it may be Ena&bholigct;ed, And bee it hereby Ena&bholigct;ed by the Kings most Excellent
Majestie by and with the advice and consent of the Lord&bholngs; and Commons in this present Parliament assembled
