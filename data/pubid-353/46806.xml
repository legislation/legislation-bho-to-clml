		<para id="p1">The Seventh Volume Of The Statutes Of The Realm contains the Statutes from
the Commencement of the Seventh and Eighth Years of the Reign of King William
the Third, A. D. 1695&ndash;6, to the End of the Reign of the same King, A. D. 1701.</para>
		<para id="p2">The Attention that has hitherto been paid to the Principles referred to in the Preface
to the Fifth Volume of the Statutes of the Realm, has not in any Degree been relaxed
in the Progress of the ensuing Volume; indeed the Consideration that is due to the High
Authority under which this great National Work is prepared, cannot fail to command the
closest Adherence to those Principles; to enlarge upon them in this Place is therefore
unnecessary.</para>
		<para id="p3">Two Engravings, the One of the Act for continuing the Imprisonment of
Counter and others, for the Conspiracy to assassinate the Person of His Sacred Majesty,
and the other for the Attainder of the pretended Prince of Wales for High Treason,
are inserted respectively at Pages 300 and 739 of this Volume.</para>
