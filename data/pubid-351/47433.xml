to be boarded, and their Goods to be taken out by Pirates and Sea-rovers, notwithstanding they have
sufficient force to defend themselves, whereby not onely the Merchants are much p&bhopcrl;judiced but the Honour of the
English Navigation is thereby much diminished, and Merchants discouraged from ladeing their Goods on Board
English Shipps to the decay of Shipping. In the p&bhopcrl;servation of which the Wealth, Honour and Safety of this
Nation is soe much concerned, To which the said Masters are incouraged by a pra&bholigct;ice used towards them by

doe not onely restore the Shipp with such Goods as are claimed by the Masters or Seamen but many times pay
unto the Masters all or some part of the Freight, which hath many times caused suspition of Treachery in the
said Masters to the great Dishonour of the English Nation. For the p&bhopcrl;vention thereof for the future and for
